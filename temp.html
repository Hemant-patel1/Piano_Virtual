          computing, it is a technology where the resource is provided as a
          service through the Internet to the user. The data that is stored can
          be files, images, documents, or any other storable document.</span

        <span
          >The Infrastructure is where the people start and begin to build from
          the scratch. This is the layer where the cloud hosting lives. Let’s
          say you have a company and a website and the website has a lot of
          communications that are exchanged between members. You start with a
          few members talking with each other and then gradually the number of
          members increases. As time passes, as the number of members increases,
          there would be more traffic on the network and your server will get
          slow down. This would cause a problem.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify">
        <span
          >A few years ago, the websites are put on the server somewhere, in
          this way you have to run around or buy and set the number of servers.
          It costs a lot of money and takes a lot of time. You pay for these
          servers when you are using them and as well as when you are not using
          them. This is called hosting. This problem is overcome by cloud
          hosting. With Cloud Computing, you have access to computing power when
          you needed. Now, your website is put in the cloud server as you put it
          on a dedicated server. People start visiting your website and if you
          suddenly need more computing power, you would scale up according to
          the need.&nbsp;</span

          <b><strong>Scalability:</strong></b
          ><span>
            With Cloud hosting, it is easy to grow and shrink the number and
            size of servers based on the need. This is done by either increasing
            or decreasing the resources in the cloud. This ability to alter
            plans due to fluctuations in business size and needs is a superb
            benefit of cloud computing, especially when experiencing a sudden
            growth in demand.</span

        </li>
        <li value="2">
          <b><strong>Save Money:</strong></b
          ><span>
            An advantage of cloud computing is the reduction in hardware costs.
            Instead of purchasing in-house equipment, hardware needs are left to
            the vendor. For companies that are growing rapidly, new hardware can
            be large, expensive, and inconvenient. Cloud computing alleviates
            these issues because resources can be acquired quickly and easily.
            Even better, the cost of repairing or replacing equipment is passed
            to the vendors. Along with purchase costs, off-site hardware cuts
            internal power costs and saves space. Large data centers can take up
            precious office space and produce a large amount of heat. Moving to
            cloud applications or storage can help maximize space and
            significantly cut energy expenditures.</span

          <b><strong>Reliability: </strong></b
          ><span
            >Rather than being hosted on one single instance of a physical
            server, hosting is delivered on a virtual partition that draws its
            resource, such as disk space, from an extensive network of
            underlying physical servers. If one server goes offline it will have
            no effect on availability, as the virtual servers will continue to
            pull resources from the remaining network of servers.</span

          <b><strong>Physical Security:</strong></b
          ><span>
            The underlying physical servers are still housed within data centers
            and so benefit from the security measures that those facilities
            implement to prevent people from accessing or disrupting them
            on-site.</span
